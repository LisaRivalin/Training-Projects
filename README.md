# [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io) Guided Projects

These projects are part of the Dataquest program. For each of them, we are following and deepening the steps suggested by Dataquest. The goal of those projects is to demonstrate that we can effectively use our skills in various contexts, using storytelling. For each project, we will describe our use case, the available data and the steps to reach our goal.
